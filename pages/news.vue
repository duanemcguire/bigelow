          We are excited to announce a contract with The Church of the Epiphany (Episcopal) in New York City for a new three manual tracker organ of 37 voices. Completion is planned for mid-2023. The hand-drawn rendering above has been submitted to
          the church for visual design approval. See <a href="/opus/44-specs">stop list</a>.

    We are pleased to announce that, after fifty years of homelessness, the only surviving work of New York organ builder Thomas Robjohn has finally found a home. It is now on permanent display at the <a target="_blank"
      href="https://mim.org/">Musical Instrument Museum</a> in Phoenix, Arizona. The 1859 instrument is fully playable, and its gorgeous walnut case, entirely veneered in rosewood, suits it well to this venue where it will be seen more often than
    heard. See specsmore photos on the <a href="/opus/37-specs">Opus 37 page</a>.

    This <strong>two-manual reed organ </strong>is certainly a rarity today. It has been thoroughly overhauled, including replacing missing or broken reeds. The sound of the full chorus (16-8-4) is rich indeed.
